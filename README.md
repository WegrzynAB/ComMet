# ComMet (COMparison of METabolic states)
ComMet is a method based on genome-scale metabolic models for comparing different metabolic states 

## Features
- in-depth characterisation of flux states achievable by genome-scale metabolic models
- comparison of flux spaces from several conditions of interest
- identification of metabolically distinct network modules
- visualization of network modules as reaction and metabolic map
